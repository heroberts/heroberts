### Hi there 👋

I am a postdoctoral researcher interested in the interactions between the environment and mental health. I am a member of the Urban Geography research group with the Department of Human Geography and Spatial Planning at Utrecht University. I currently work on the NEEDS[https://needs.sites.uu.nl/] project, where I look at depression within the context of the daily space-time path.

More information on my research and teaching can be found on my website[heroberts.github.io].
